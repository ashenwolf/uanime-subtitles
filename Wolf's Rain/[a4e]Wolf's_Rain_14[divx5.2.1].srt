1
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,806
Kiba!

2
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,781
Wait up, damn it!

3
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,854
You're going too fast!
Let's rest for a while.

4
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,833
We don't have time.

5
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,596
Think it through,
damn it!

6
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,438
We've got a girl
and a kid with us!

7
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,303
We can hear you, Hige.

8
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,741
Don't worry about me,
I can keep up.

9
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,301
Me, too...

10
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,775
He's the one who wants
to rest, that's all.

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,982
I do not!
I just...

12
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,177
But there's some sense
in what Hige's saying.

13
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,922
At this rate, none
of us will make it.

14
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,424
Let's wait over there for
the snowstorm to die down.

15
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,195
I guess that settles it. Can you
hang in there a little longer?

16
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,568
You should worry
about yourself.

17
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,628
Yes, ma'am,
you're right.

18
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,233
Let's go.

19
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,294
It'll be dawn soon.
Let's rest here until then.

20
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:23,368
Let's do that, Kiba.
The snowstorm will let up by then.

21
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,694
It already is.

22
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,798
Let's go.
It'll be fine.

23
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,034
We won't be fine!

24
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,145
I'm going anyway.

25
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,845
I can handle it.

26
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,219
Yeah, let's go.

27
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,154
Forget it! I'm staying here
until morning.

28
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,155
I understand.

29
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,293
Kiba!

30
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,161
Let him go!

31
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,185
But...

32
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,962
All he has eyes for
right now is Cheza.

33
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,624
Whether we're with him or not
doesn't make any difference.

34
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:02,130
We'll go after him later. For now,
clear your head and rest up.

35
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,379
Are you really
sure about this?

36
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,375
That guy obsesses
too much.

37
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,308
So, I take it you didn't
like that scarf.

38
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,444
Too bad, I thought it would
look good on you.

39
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,023
Okay, maybe not.

40
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,024
Lunkhead.

41
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,034
Cheza is...

42
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,041
She's a girl that was created from
Lunar Flowers using alchemy.

43
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,608
And the man who created
Cheza was Darcia the First.

44
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,014
Lord Orkham stole her
and had us study her.

45
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,084
To awaken her and open
the door to Paradise.

46
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,961
Paradise...

47
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,291
It's a world where
wolves reign.

48
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:42,231
And Lunar Flowers are there to guide
the world's remaining wolves to Paradise.

49
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,718
Did you know all this
from the very beginning?

50
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,581
Who did you learn
it from, then?!

51
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,557
Wait a minute! You mean at the castle
we're headed to, there's...

52
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,827
A world of wolves, huh?

53
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:15,072
If a place like that is Paradise, I'll head straight
on down to Hell if it's all the same to you.

54
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,509
You were awake?

55
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,574
It's too cold
to stay drunk.

56
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,278
The Book of the Moon
isn't just some story.

57
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,586
Maybe so.

58
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:31,319
But even if you're right,
what can we humans do?

59
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,822
I'll never forgive wolves.

60
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:40,194
Even if they are the ones
who rule this world,

61
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,227
I'm gonna exterminate
every last one of 'em.

62
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,144
Lord Darcia. Inside
the keep, there is...

63
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,647
A wolf?

64
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:41,885
Yes.

65
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,926
Now that I have lost you, my beloved,
Paradise holds no meaning for me.

66
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,396
And yet...

67
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,702
This wolf's eye throbs.

68
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,968
Why?

69
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,113
What is this feeling that
threatens to overwhelm me...

70
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,010
My beloved Hamona...
Tell me.

71
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,549
What should l...

72
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,034
He is here.

73
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,457
This is Darcia's keep, huh?

74
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,760
This looks like the sort of place
that would be haunted.

75
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,818
By what?

76
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,230
The ghosts of
cursed Nobles.

77
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,959
Come on, don't talk about
stuff like that!

78
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,200
Still, are you sure that
girl is really here?

79
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,130
It's faint, but I smell
a Lunar Flower.

80
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,606
Looks like he already
has visitors.

81
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,586
Blue!

82
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,859
It's Pops!

83
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,727
Hey, what's gotten
into you?!

84
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,535
Let's go!

85
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,841
Who are the Nobles,
anyway?

86
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,613
Most of the literature
dealing with them...

87
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,980
...was lost with the decline
of civilization.

88
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,081
But we do know
a few things.

89
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,949
They say that long before the
world became as it is now,

90
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,129
they extolled the virtues
of civilization,

91
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:02,089
using their fantastic alchemy
to blaze a path to the stars,

92
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,836
and open doors into
space and time.

93
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,896
But all that vanished
in an instant.

94
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,812
No one knows what
happened then.

95
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,680
But many people
disappeared,

96
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:21,612
and the inner workings of alchemy came
to be a secret known only to the Nobles...

97
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,048
...that was not to be passed
on to the people.

98
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,289
That was more than
two hundred years ago.

99
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,128
And now this world
is quietly passing away.

100
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,902
Along with the
red moon.

101
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,136
They are here.

102
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,493
Cheza!

103
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,288
Kiba!

104
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,172
Why are you in
such a rush?

105
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,741
He's here.
Pops is here...

106
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,744
Do you really want to
see this "Pops" guy?

107
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,745
No. It would be better
if I didn't.

108
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,780
Maybe he's looking
for you, Blue.

109
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,252
And what if he is?

110
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,263
Are you gonna go back
to being a dog?

111
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,934
Hey, lay off!

112
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,630
You don't know what
it feels like, Tsume!

113
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,298
I guess I don't.

114
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,639
I've never been kept as a pet
by humans like you two.

115
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,369
Now, now, first things first.
Let's find Kiba and Cheza.

116
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,407
The flower scent is coming
from this way.

117
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,759
Wolf worship, huh?

118
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,395
It's not a simple
animal cult.

119
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,125
I think this world has split into
a world that we humans can see...

120
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,971
...and a world that we lost
sight of at some point.

121
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,136
I'm certain that the animals
are aware of that.

122
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,380
Including wolves, huh?

123
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,575
What brought that on?

124
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,512
I was born
allergic to dogs.

125
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,027
I see. They must be
off that way, then.

126
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,620
Allergies can
come in handy.

127
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,257
Glad I could help.

128
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,083
Kiba!

129
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,652
Cheza!

130
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,552
Have you come
for revenge, wolf?

131
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,722
Don't hurt Cheza.

132
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,900
Cheza is merely an embodiment of
Lunar Flowers that we created.

133
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,565
Why do you want
Cheza so badly?

134
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,672
I don't know who
you Nobles are.

135
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,948
And I don't care what
you people are.

136
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:15,176
Cheza is going to tell us
the way to Paradise.

137
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,182
Wolf... It all began
with your kind.

138
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,433
What is it?

139
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,166
Hey!

140
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,674
You and your kind stole
everything from me.

141
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:48,512
And in return, you gave me a curse.
And suffering. And grief.

142
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:54,084
And this eye became
just like yours.

143
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,629
All this was the price I paid
for being cursed by Paradise.

144
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,725
And now... all I am surrounded
by is despair.

145
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,439
Don't! What is it
that you want?!

146
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,037
Have you found it?
Have you found Paradise?

147
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,740
We will.
No matter what!

148
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,183
What is it that you expect
to find in Paradise?

149
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,144
A future.

150
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,487
A future?

151
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,216
Not hope. Not despair.
Just a future.

152
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,492
Nothing more.

153
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,728
I no longer have
any need...

154
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,741
...for a future.

155
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,679
You damn wolf!

156
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,615
No, don't!

157
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,926
Blue...

158
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,567
Kiba!

159
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,049
Lord Darcia!

160
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,790
Cheza!

161
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,592
Kiba!

162
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,435
CHEZA!

163
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,697
Blue!

164
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,003
Cheza!

165
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,865
We need to hurry!

166
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,378
Why?

167
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,770
Why, Blue...?

168
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,483
Quent!

169
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,182
Blue!

170
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,197
Jaguara!

171
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,299
That way!

172
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,628
Did that wolf
just talk...?!

173
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:41,787
Kiba!

174
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,845
Don't go after them!

175
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,846
Kiba!

176
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,808
Kiba!

177
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,942
Kiba!

178
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,239
Kiba!

179
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,374
Kiba!

180
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,550
Kiba!

181
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,771
The Fallen Keep

182
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:07,786
Next Time

183
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,820
Next Time
A human life is an
ephemeral thing.

184
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,878
A human life is an
ephemeral thing.

185
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,747
It is a good idea to look
to the past from time to time.

186
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,456
But perhaps my life is a trifle too long
to look back and dwell upon.

187
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:18,830
And so,
I bid you farewell.

188
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,499
Grey Wolf
And so,
I bid you farewell.

189
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,796
Grey Wolf
